                <p>To ride the storm, to an empire of the cloud<br>
                    To ride the storm, they climbed aboard their silver ghost<br>
                    To ride the storm, to a kingdom that will come<br>
                    To ride the storm, and damn the rest, oblivion<br>
                    <br>
                    Royalty and dignitaries, brandy and cigars<br>
                    Gray lady giant of the skies, you hold them in your arms<br>
                    The millionth chance they laughed, to take down
                    His Majesty’s craft<br>
                    “To India” they say, “magic carpet float away”, an October fateful day<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mist is in the trees, stone sweats with the dew<br>
                    The morning sunrise, red before the blue<br>
                    <br>
                    Hanging at the mast, waiting for command<br>
                    His Majesty’s airship, the R101<br><br>

                    She’s the biggest vessel built by man, a giant of the skies<br>
                    For all you unbelievers, the Titanic fits inside<br>
                    Drum rolled tight, her canvas skin, silvered in the sun<br>
                    Never tested with the fury, with a beating yet to come<br>
                    The fury yet to come….<br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the gathering gloom, the storm rising in the West<br>
                    The Coxswain stared into the plunging weather glass<br>
                    We must go now, we must take our chance with fate<br>
                    We must go now, for politician, he can’t be late<br><br>
                    
                    The airship crew awake for thirty hours at full stretch,<br>
                    But the ship is in their backbone, every sinew, every inch<br>
                    She never flew at full speed, a trial never done<br>
                    Her fragile outer cover, her Achilles would become<br>
                    An Achilles yet to come...<br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sailors of the sky, a hardened breed<br>
                    Loyal to the King, and an airship creed<br>
                    The engines drum, the telegraph sounds<br>
                    Release the cords that bind us to the ground<br><br>

                    Said the Coxswain ,“Sir, she’s heavy, she’ll never make this flight.”<br>
                    Said the Captain, “Damn the cargo! We’ll be on our way tonight.”<br>
                    Groundlingsn cheered in wonder, as she backed up from the mast<br>
                    Baptizing them her water, from the ballast fore and aft<br>
                    Now she slips into our past…<br><br>


                    Fighting the wind as it rolls you<br>
                    Feeling the diesels that push you along<br>
                    Watching the channel below you,<br>
                    Lower and lower, into the night<br><br>


                    Lights are passing below you<br>
                    Northern France, asleep in their beds<br>
                    Storm is raging around you,<br>
                    A million to one, that’s what they say<br>


                    Reaper standing beside her<br>
                    With his scythe cuts to the bone<br>
                    Panic to make a decision<br>
                    Experienced men, asleep in their graves<br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cover is ripped and she’s drowning<br>
                    Rain is flooding into the hold<br>
                    Bleeding to death and she’s falling<br>
                    Lifting gas is draining away<br><br>


                    “We’re down lads!” came the cry, bow plunging from the sky<br>
                    Three thousand horses silent as the ship began to die<br>
                    The flares to guide her path ignited at the last<br>
                    The empire of the clouds, just ashes in our past<br>
                    Just ashes at the last…<br><br>


                    Here lie their dreams, as i I stand in the sun<br>
                    On the ground where they built, and the engines did run<br>
                    To the moon and the stars, now what have we done?<br>
                    Oh the dreamers may die, but the dreams live on<br>
                    Dreams live on<br>
                    Dreams live on<br><br>


                    Now a shadow on a hill, the angel of the East<br>
                    The empire of the clouds may rest in peace<br>
                    And in a country churchyard, laid head to the mast<br>
                    Eight and fourty souls, who came to die in France…<br><br>
