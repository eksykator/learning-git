                <p>To ride the storm, to an empire of the cloud
                    To ride the storm, they climbed aboard their silver ghost
                    To ride the storm, to a kingdom that will come
                    To ride the storm, and damn the rest, oblivion
                    
                    Royalty and dignitaries, brandy and cigars
                    Gray lady giant of the skies, you hold them in your arms
                    The millionth chance they laughed, to take down
                    His Majesty’s craft
                    “To India” they say, “magic carpet float away”, an October fateful day
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mist is in the trees, stone sweats with the dew
                    The morning sunrise, red before the blue
                    
                    Hanging at the mast, waiting for command
                    His Majesty’s airship, the R101

                    She’s the biggest vessel built by man, a giant of the skies
                    For all you unbelievers, the Titanic fits inside
                    Drum rolled tight, her canvas skin, silvered in the sun
                    Never tested with the fury, with a beating yet to come
                    The fury yet to come….
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the gathering gloom, the storm rising in the West
                    The Coxswain stared into the plunging weather glass
                    We must go now, we must take our chance with fate
                    We must go now, for politician, he can’t be late
                    
                    The airship crew awake for thirty hours at full stretch,
                    But the ship is in their backbone, every sinew, every inch
                    She never flew at full speed, a trial never done
                    Her fragile outer cover, her Achilles would become
                    An Achilles yet to come...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sailors of the sky, a hardened breed
                    Loyal to the King, and an airship creed
                    The engines drum, the telegraph sounds
                    Release the cords that bind us to the ground

                    Said the Coxswain ,“Sir, she’s heavy, she’ll never make this flight.”
                    Said the Captain, “Damn the cargo! We’ll be on our way tonight.”
                    Groundlingsn cheered in wonder, as she backed up from the mast
                    Baptizing them her water, from the ballast fore and aft
                    Now she slips into our past…


                    Fighting the wind as it rolls you
                    Feeling the diesels that push you along
                    Watching the channel below you,
                    Lower and lower, into the night


                    Lights are passing below you
                    Northern France, asleep in their beds
                    Storm is raging around you,
                    A million to one, that’s what they say


                    Reaper standing beside her
                    With his scythe cuts to the bone
                    Panic to make a decision
                    Experienced men, asleep in their graves
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cover is ripped and she’s drowning
                    Rain is flooding into the hold
                    Bleeding to death and she’s falling
                    Lifting gas is draining away


                    “We’re down lads!” came the cry, bow plunging from the sky
                    Three thousand horses silent as the ship began to die
                    The flares to guide her path ignited at the last
                    The empire of the clouds, just ashes in our past
                    Just ashes at the last…


                    Here lie their dreams, as i I stand in the sun
                    On the ground where they built, and the engines did run
                    To the moon and the stars, now what have we done?
                    Oh the dreamers may die, but the dreams live on
                    Dreams live on
                    Dreams live on


                    Now a shadow on a hill, the angel of the East
                    The empire of the clouds may rest in peace
                    And in a country churchyard, laid head to the mast
                    Eight and fourty souls, who came to die in France…
