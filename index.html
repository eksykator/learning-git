            <p>To ride the storm, to an empire of the cloud<br>
                To ride the storm, they climbed aboard their silver ghost<br>
                To ride the storm, to a kingdom that will come<br>
                To ride the storm, and damn the rest, oblivion<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Royalty and dignitaries, brandy and cigars<br>
                Gray lady giant of the skies, you hold them in your arms<br>
                The millionth chance they laughed, to take down
                His Majesty’s craft<br>
                “To India” they say, “magic carpet float away”, an October fateful day
            </p>
            <p>
                Mist is in the trees, stone sweats with the dew<br>
                The morning sunrise, red before the blue
            </p>
            <p>
                Hanging at the mast, waiting for command<br>
                His Majesty’s airship, the R101
            </p>
            <p>
                She’s the biggest vessel built by man, a giant of the skies<br>
                For all you unbelievers, the Titanic fits inside<br>
                Drum rolled tight, her canvas skin, silvered in the sun<br>
                Never tested with the fury, with a beating yet to come<br>
                The fury yet to come….
            </p>
            <p>
                In the gathering gloom, the storm rising in the West<br>
                The Coxswain stared into the plunging weather glass<br>
                We must go now, we must take our chance with fate<br>
                We must go now, for politician, he can’t be late
            </p>
            <p>
                The airship crew awake for thirty hours at full stretch,<br>
                But the ship is in their backbone, every sinew, every inch<br>
                She never flew at full speed, a trial never done<br>
                Her fragile outer cover, her Achilles would become<br>
                An Achilles yet to come...
            </p>
            <p>
                Sailors of the sky, a hardened breed<br>
                Loyal to the King, and an airship creed<br>
                The engines drum, the telegraph sounds<br>
                Release the cords that bind us to the ground
            </p>
            <p>
                Said the Coxswain ,“Sir, she’s heavy, she’ll never make this flight.”<br>
                Said the Captain, “Damn the cargo! We’ll be on our way tonight.”<br>
                Groundlingsn cheered in wonder, as she backed up from the mast<br>
                Baptizing them her water, from the ballast fore and aft<br>
                Now she slips into our past…
            </p>
            <p>
                Fighting the wind as it rolls you<br>
                Feeling the diesels that push you along<br>
                Watching the channel below you,<br>
                Lower and lower, into the night
            </p>
            <p>
                Lights are passing below you<br>
                Northern France, asleep in their beds<br>
                Storm is raging around you,<br>
                A million to one, that’s what they say
            </p>
            <p>
                Reaper standing beside her<br>
                With his scythe cuts to the bone<br>
                Panic to make a decision<br>
                Experienced men, asleep in their graves
            </p>
            <p>
                The cover is ripped and she’s drowning<br>
                Rain is flooding into the hold<br>
                Bleeding to death and she’s falling<br>
                Lifting gas is draining away
            </p>
            <p>
                “We’re down lads!” came the cry, bow plunging from the sky<br>
                Three thousand horses silent as the ship began to die<br>
                The flares to guide her path ignited at the last<br>
                The empire of the clouds, just ashes in our past<br>
                Just ashes at the last…
            </p>
            <p>
                Here lie their dreams, as i I stand in the sun<br>
                On the ground where they built, and the engines did run<br>
                To the moon and the stars, now what have we done?<br>
                Oh the dreamers may die, but the dreams live on<br>
                Dreams live on<br>
                Dreams live on
            </p>
            <p>
                Now a shadow on a hill, the angel of the East<br>
                The empire of the clouds may rest in peace<br>
                And in a country churchyard, laid head to the mast<br>
                Eight and fourty souls, who came to die in France…
