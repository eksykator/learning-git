                <p>To ride the storm, to an empire of the cloud
                    To ride the storm, they climbed aboard their silver ghost
                    To ride the storm, to a kingdom that will come
                    To ride the storm, and damn the rest, oblivion
                    
                    Royalty and dignitaries, brandy and cigars
                    Gray lady giant of the skies, you hold them in your arms
                    The millionth chance they laughed, to take down
                    His Majesty’s craft
                    “To India” they say, “magic carpet float away”, an October fateful day
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mist is in the trees, stone sweats with the dew
                    The morning sunrise, red before the blue
                    
                    Hanging at the mast, waiting for command
                    His Majesty’s airship, the R101

                    She’s the biggest vessel built by man, a giant of the skies
                    For all you unbelievers, the Titanic fits inside
                    Drum rolled tight, her canvas skin, silvered in the sun
                    Never tested with the fury, with a beating yet to come
                    The fury yet to come….
